@door7639,"Grass is a type of plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks. Grass is usually the color green. Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants.

The grasses include the ""grass"" of the family Poaceae. This family is also called Gramineae. The family also include some of the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae).[1] These three families are not closely related but all of them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a common life-style.

The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, sprouted grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatching thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others.

Many grasses are short, but some grasses can grow tall, such as bamboo. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places and make grasslands, including areas which are very arid or cold. There are several other plants that look similar to grass and are referred to as such, but are not members of the grass family. These plants include rushes, reeds, papyrus and water chestnut. Seagrass is a monocot in the order Alismatales.

Grasses are an important food for many animals, such as deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows.[2] This is a part of why the plants are successful. Without grass, soil may wash away into rivers (erosion).",TRUE

@doc7810,I personally don't have a problem with someone who is in lgbtq or any of the sort. It's just that the MAIN issue is that it has become this inconceivably hostile and toxic community that is so difficult to get yourself to respect it sometimes because of the constant shoving of their sexualities in your face or reminding you consistently that they are this gender or that they are gay and whatnot. If you're gay or trans that's completely fine but jesus christ stop constantly shoving it in people's faces and making it your whole personality that you are said gender and/or sexuality. Just move on. LGBTQ representation is genuinely good if done correctly and not forced for the sake of being forced.,TRUE

They feel the need to ""educate"" you like you don't know anything and ignore what you say because as I mentioned your opinions mean nothing.

Then the do their best to live in accordance to validate such a belief.  You know what's worse than living through pain. Being spiritually held back.  By one's ancient descendents everyday poor choices.  Example wearing makeup beauty supplies clothing so forth and so on that is made to the lowest standards of quality which contain substances materials that stem from poisonous chemicals that never change their killing composition. Which means whether it is a solid liquid burnt off into our airways atmosphere as a vapor is always going to be poisonous debilitating deadly to the body at the same time polluting corrupting devastating to mother Earth and all the various different forms of life that live within this world. Another example being soft lazy out of shape overfed under nourished overworked underpaid weakling with a dirty low-paying job. Basically neglecting one's own physical freedom throughout their life.       In layman's terms no one can express receive love or any other desired emotion in its entirety if the don't know themselves from the inside out.   So learn your body's capabilities and limitations by fully engaging with all the body senses to their extreme limits in the most efficient way that is humanly possible.  Become physically fit mentally sound spiritually balanced being able to express physical freedom which is key for one to start living up to the pleasure potential responsibility of femininity and masculinity. For only at this level of body awareness does one actually naturally constantly consistently have the self-control discipline loyalty devotion appreciation respect confidence playful determination. To consciously acknowledge physically participate in being true towards love honor and the creation of life in the way of being a mother or father parent possible Guardian caretaker. This greatest most pleasurable of all responsibilities would also instinctively include a method of parenting upbringing that would quantify the chances of infant baby newborn toddler young child teenager growing developing maturing into a strong confident healthy successful fun-loving intellectual adult that can joyfully make their way through life as a (single married) leading or simply just being a healthy happy productive part of a massive group which is society.	Option number two alone not quite as exciting physically mentally spiritually challenging rewarding nonetheless a quantum leap in progress from the way the mass majority of the population throughout the history of mankind has been living dying off lacking more so here in America. More specifically Donald Trump and like-minded. 	Is to have had the wisdom and knowledge physical capabilities of being able to ground in pound slip and grip  into paradise so intensely intimately that it gets the soul and spirit off with no negativity attached maybe even in the free and clear. Possible for a person to be a combination of all these best case scenarios situation combined is one. Unfortunately the mass majority of today's population from coast to coast globally again more desperate here in America are content living dying off having only used the smallest percentage of a fraction of the true potential they were first born with.  I must say being feebleminded physically inadequate submissive subservient may be genetically inherited or a simple generic learned behavior most likely for today's population again more so here in America even more specifically Donald Trump and his sellout suck up traitor to America trumpet blowers to be a combination of all those worst-case scenarios combined is one. Which also includes being a sexual failure sexual criminal.   Keep in mind sexual crimes are classified as the weakest form of criminal conduct.   Which is one of my primary points everything sissy boys supreme does permeates out weakness.  Subconsciously he knows this. Is part of the reason why he and Mitch McConnell the Republican Party for the last 60 years.  Have had the false belief if the mass majority of the population is at their worst. They will look their best and feel less afraid scared of dominant gentleman and women that are demonstrating high-class sophistication which is a form of femininity at its finest. and these points should be instinctively in heart considering the simple logic basic concept that if life is not free why the hell would death be any cheaper? It's not guaranteed. A question the common basic average normal man or woman may be able to wonder is the spiritual cost to one's own soul and spirit when the freely live and die off having only used the smallest percentage of a fraction of the true potential they were first born with basically neglecting their own physical freedom throughout their life.  Unfortunately this self-neglect reckless desperate ignorant stupidity has been exacerbated by global pollution.

I also don‚Äôt like how they shove it up in your face threat their in the community and make their sexuality a personality. I also, don‚Äôt really like people in the community, since they can be hypocrites, rude, ignorant, and careless. I have both met people like these (Who are cool and who are..) and it‚Äôs honestly dumb how people I‚Äôve met think they‚Äôre superior to other people. I also don‚Äôt like how they make fun of my religion, or how they disrespect it by calling it old, and stupid to follow, and calling us Homophobic because we can‚Äôt support them. They can be careless around people on pride month, and try to make any living remark only about them and be rude to the people around them (kids) who shouldn‚Äôt know this stuff until they are old enough.

@fav843,"I'm trans and I honestly am alienated by the ""community"".

The only thing we have in common is our sexuality, but that is but a tiny part of our lives. We have our own individual interests and shit and everything doesn't have to revolve around you being LGBT. Obviously people hate us, but that is so tiny these days that they aren't even a threat. I hate being trans, and I wish I was literally a normal person. Hate gender dysphoria. It's a stupid medical issue and I wish I wasn't born with it. I just want to live a normal life. I never understood those trans people that are openly trans and put in zero effort to blend in. But whatever. It doesn't automatically make them bad people, but I wouldn't do that myself. It just comes off weird to me. 

Being gay or lesbian or bisexual doesn't have to define you. Just live on. People are going to be bigoted or ignorant about you, but there are tons of people who just don't care. Most adults judge people on the content of their character, not the labels attached to them. It doesn't matter what you are, someone will hate you. Obviously some groups get it more than others, but at the end of the day someone loves you. I'm tired of being defined simply for my labels. I try to be a good person and that's all I need to do. 

Are there obnoxious people in the LGBT community? Hell yes. Are there perverted degenerates among us? Yes. We aren't special. We are a mixed bag. We can be complete monsters or angels. This is why I hate ""communities"" and ""groups"" because everyone is fucking different and shouldn't be definined by labels.

The thing is that most of us are normal. Hell, most of this comment section is filled with LGBT people who feel the same way I do. We just want to be a part of society. We don't want it to revolve around us. We just want to live normal lives.

We have bigger issues anyways that affect everyone. Poverty, homelessness, hunger, unemployment, poor infrastructure, bad health, a failing government, climate change, and it seems like we are too focused on social issues to fix these real problems. We need to focus on everyone. If you really want to help minorities without abandoning the majority, we need to fix the issues that affect all of us. I feel like if we unite on that, we will find that we have a lot in common and that we can come together with a better understanding of each other. We all suffer. We all have problems. And we all just want a better world. 

Politicians. If you want to help minorities, that's fine, but don't ignore the majority. Help all of us. Please. Focusing on minorities alienates the majority and it causes more infighting. Fix the damn country. We are dying out here.",TRUE

@mrok3405,"Sexuality should never define your identity and concept of self. Sexuality is a tiny portion of your life. It's not significant, as many people live without sex and many choose to not even have  a partner. Sex itself makes up a tiny percentage of what is involved in a  relationship in heterosexual couples. Why is it such a big issue for gay or LGBTQ people? In relationships, compatibility, shared interests, and having similarities are what makes or determines successful relationships.  The LGBTQ movement seems to have gone beyond a healthy understanding of sexuality. Stop sexualising everything in your existence and start living free because no one really cares about what others do in their own bedroom..there's no need to advertise it everywhere you go and make it so publicly heard and known as your defining point.",TRUE

its a matter of forcing it down peoples throats and telling children that are 5 and 6 years old that they can choose whether to be any gender they want and painting rainbow flags at all the intersections. not allowing people to question it at all under threat of so called hate speech. the list is endless. oh and that young child thats been dancing at a gay bar in the bronx dressed as a drag queen prostitute for grown men with erections who are throwing money at him, and hanging out with a convicted drug dealer who murdered and dismembered a person and served a prison sentence.
THATS the real fuckin problem here. and i have heard more often than not when i speak with people in this community that they think thats obviously a problem as well. its an agenda, probably eventually to get people to accept pedophilia like these ""virtuous pedophiles"" out there. google those ridiculous scumbags and see what you find.

4) Have the questions remained consistent every year? 

These are things not addressed  in this clip and given the group conducting the study has clear motivation to show bias I believe it wise to show a healthy amount of skepticism towards anything they publish.

Many families feel that the lack of boundaries makes it forcably an adult oriented fest, one that is NOT family oriented.
There IS an assumption there however, that family oriented activities dont role model interpersonal relationships between adults, or feel straight role modelling is the only acceptable-appropriate type in family oriented settings..
Not saying its right or wrong, but with blurred lines between the two 'worlds' its easy to see why those rigidly set in their thinking would see some of the fests as further 'proof' to the whole orientation as inappropriate.
